# Documentation

The "`documentation`" section is simply a list of URIs for any kind of documentation that maintainers want to provide to the community (project adopters, contributors, security researchers, etc.).

```yaml
documentation:
  - http://foo.bar/wiki
```

This section is not required. It is an array containing links to the project documentation (docs, wiki, etc.). Every item must be a string that meets the IRI standard (RFC 3987) and begin with `https://`.
