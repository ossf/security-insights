# Vulnerability Reporting

The "`vulnerability-reporting`" section provides policies and procedures about how to report properly a security issue. In this section, security researchers can easily find information about the security policy, contacts, bug bounty program, and in-scope and out-of-scope areas. This section is **required**. It is strongly recommended - if the project is maintained and active - to accept vulnerability reports and have a security policy (e.g., `SECURITY.md`).

```yaml
vulnerability-reporting:
  accepts-vulnerability-reports: true
  email-contact: security@something.com
  security-policy: https://foo.bar/reporting.html
  bug-bounty-available: true
  bug-bounty-url: https://foo.bar/bugs.html
  in-scope:
  - broken access control
  - other
  out-scope:
  - other
