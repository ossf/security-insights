## Supply-chain

**Description:** Attackers can obtain the control of a third-party sources (e.g. website 
domain, server, etc) linked in the `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml`.

**Mitigation:** Maintainers could self-host the evidence to reduce risks.

## False information in the SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml

**Description:** Maintainers could upload false information in the `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml` 
just to obtain a high score from the scanners or other services which use SECURITY-
INSIGHTS to evaluate the project.

**Mitigation:** Scanners could introduce some additional checks (e.g. check if URLs 
return 200 OK status) and a weighted score to reduce the risks. In addition, the open-source
community can read the YAML file and report false information (or just information without clear evidence).

## Private information sharing

**Description:** A maintainer shares mistakenly private critical information (e.g. security audit
containing unpatched vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation:** 

## Malicious pull-request

**Description:** A malicious contributor could introduce false or malicious information (e.g.
malicious URLs) to obtain a particular advantage.

**Mitigation:** The contributors' PRs to `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml` should be carefully reviewed and
approved by the maintainers. In addition, the maintainers could decide to not
accept direct contributions to the `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml`.

## Missing pull-request review or lacks in the review process

**Description:** Missing PR review or lack in the review process can lead to the tampering of
`SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml` by adding false information.

**Mitigation:** The PR should be formally reviewed and approved by another maintainer.
