# Security Insights Specification _(v2.2.0-dev)_

SecurityInsights defines a schema that projects can use to report information about their security in a machine-processable way. The data tracked within this specification is intended to fill the gaps between simplified solutions such as SECURITY.md and comprehensive automated solutions such as SBOMs. In that gap lay elements that must be self-reported by projects to allow end-users to make informed security decisions.

Required:

- `header`

Optional:

- `project`
- `repository`

---

**Table of Contents**

* 
{:toc}

---

## `header`

header captures high level metadata about the schema.

- **Type**: [Header]

Required if `header` is present:

- `last-reviewed`
- `last-updated`
- `schema-version`
- `url`

Optional:

- `comment`
- `project-si-source`

---

### `header.comment` (optional)

Additional information about the schema.

- **Type**: `string`

---

### `header.last-reviewed`

The date when the document or data was last reviewed.

- **Type**: [Date]

---

### `header.last-updated`

The date when the document or data was last updated.

- **Type**: [Date]

---

### `header.project-si-source` (optional)

A URL to the security insights file that contains project information for this file to inherit. The URL provided here should respond to an unauthenticated GET request and return a valid security insights file using a content-type of "text/plain" or "application/yaml". This is useful for projects that are part of a larger organization or ecosystem, where much of the security insights data is shared across multiple projects.

- **Type**: [URL]

---

### `header.schema-version`

The version of the Security Insights schema being used.

- **Type**: [SchemaVersion]

---

### `header.url`

The original URL for the current Security Insights file. This should point to the canonical location where the file is hosted (e.g., a raw file URL in a version control system). This helps preserve context when the file is extracted from its source. This may also be referenced to help readers find the latest version of the security insights file, in the event that they are accessing it from an outdated source, such as a past release artifact. This is not to be confused with the URL for the project. Project URLs should be specified in `project.repositories` instead.

- **Type**: [URL]
