# Scope

This specification provides a mechanism for projects to report information about their security in a machine-processable way. It is formatted as a YAML file to make it easy to read and edit by humans.

Values that are included within the specification may be required or optional. Optional values are recommendations from the Open Source Security Foundation's Metrics and Metadata Working Group, but may not be prudent for all use cases.
